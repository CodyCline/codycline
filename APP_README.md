1.  **`/src`**: Contains all of the code related to the front-end presentation of the site (the browser).
    1.  **`/assets`**: Static files such as logos, fonts, pictures.
    2. **`/components`**: Core part of the project which contains components that make up the website.
    3. **`/pages`**: Individual static pages such as index or contact.
    4. **`/styles`**: CSS and Sass modules which define color schemes, variables for the whole project.
    5. **`/templates`**: Dynamic pages such as blog posts.
    6. **`/types`**: Typescript definitions for all components.
    7. **`/utils`**: Miscellaneous or higher-order-functions (HOC).

2.  **`/content`**: Markdown files for things like blog posts projects, snippets

3.  **`/functions`**: Serverless functions which handle things like HTTP security headers, analytics, etc.

4.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

5.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

6.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

7.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

8.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

9.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

10.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

11. **`create-XXX-pages.js`**: These files configure the creation of dynamic pages for separate types of contents such as blog posts or tag pages. More information on the [Gatsby create pages API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/creating-and-modifying-pages/)

12.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

13. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

14. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

15. **`tsconfig.json`**: Typescript configuration file.

16. **`README.md`**: This file you are reading.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd codycline/
    npx gatsby develop #or npm start
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
