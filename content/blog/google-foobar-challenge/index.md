### TL;DR
Repo with full answers, explanations (work in progress) is located [here](https://github.com/CodyCline/google_foobar_answers).

Some time ago, I had the opportunity of going through the Google Foobar Challenge.
For those of you who are unfamiliar with this, it's a semi-secret, invite-only programming challenge created by Google. 

The objective is to test you with 5 distinct levels of algorithm challenges. 
Each challenge increases in difficulty as it progreses.

The location of their app is [here](https://foobar.withgoogle.com). 

If you reach the end of level three, you may submit contact information and be connected to a Google Recruiter to discuss potential career prospects at the company.

*All of my answers are written in Python, however, there are other github repositories with the Java answers.*

It's unclear what you have to specifically do to get selected by the Google Foobar challenge; the general consensus 
is that you need to be searching a lot of programming related queries. I got selected when searching "testing in the cloud" -- it's probably different for everyone.


Without further delay, lets start our step-by-step walthrough! 

# Challenge 1 

---

## Braille Translation

The first challenge involves you translating plain text into braille. However, this braille is a little different,
the bumps of braille are represented as ones and blank space is represented as zeroes. You also need to handle the edge case of capital letters by adding `000001` in front of the letter. 

This implementation uses a dictionary which maps the alphabet to their binary format. Next, it loops through a given string, such as `balloon` checks if each character is uppercase 

```python
alphabet = { 
    "a": "100000", "b": "110000", "c": "100100",
    "d": "100110", "e": "100010", "f": "110100",
    "g": "110110", "h": "110010", "i": "010100",
    "j": "010110", "k": "101000", "l": "111000",
    "m": "101100", "n": "101110", "o": "101010",
    "p": "111100", "q": "111110", "r": "111010",
    "s": "011100", "t": "011110", "u": "101001",
    "v": "111001", "w": "010111", "x": "101101",
    "y": "101111", "z": "101011", " ": "000000"
}


def answer(plaintext):
    output=""
    for char in plaintext:
        if char.isupper(): #If its uppercase add the prefix
            output=output + "000001"
        #Lowercase the char to excape the capital
        output += alphabet[char.lower()] 
    return output
```

## Part 1: Bunny Prisoner Locating

The concept of this challenge is essentially you're iterating through an (x,y) 
coordinate grid which is shaped like a right triangle. 
The pattern here is starting upwards the (y) increment is x, then x+1. 
The right (x) increment is x+1.  

The number matrix  
| 7 12 18 25 33 42 52 63  
| 4 8 13 19 26 34 43 53 64  
| 2 5 9 14 20 27 35 44 54 65   
| 1 3 6 10 15 21 28 36 45 55 66  
  
```python
def solution(x, y):
    cell_number = 0 
    x_count = 0 
    while x_count < x: 
        x_count += 1 
        cell_number += x_count
        if x_count == x: #If equal to x_count
            y_count = 1 
            y_increment = x_count #Copy the current x_count and then iterate
            while y_count < y: 
                y_count += 1
                cell_number += y_increment
                y_increment += 1
            return(str(cell_number))

```

## Part 2: Please Pass the Coded Messages
In this challenge, you are given an array of different numbers. 
Find a way to combine them into an integer which is divisible by 3. 
  
For instance, if you were given "5" and "1" you would turn it into a 15.
  
> ðŸ‘‰ A number is divisible by three if the sum of its digits are divisble by three. An example of that would be `[6, 3, 3]` => 12 => 12 / 3 = 4   
  

For this example you need to first sort the list from highest to lowest, take out any number which doesn't make it possible then reassemble the numbers into a single integer. So, [3, 1, 4, 1] => 4311.

```python 
from itertools import combinations
#First sort the list from high to low
#Then loop from the list in reverse
def solution(l):
    l.sort(reverse=True)
    for i in reversed(range(1, len(l) + 1)):
        #Find combinations possible combinations
        for com in combinations(l, i):
            print(com)
            #If the sum of the potential combination is divisible by 3 
            #return its whole number concatenated
            if sum(com) % 3 == 0: 
                return int(''.join(map(str, com)))
    return 0 
    

def is_possible_to_make_divisible(arr): 
    # Find remainder of sum when divided by 3 
    remainder = 0
    for i in range (0, 3): 
        remainder = (remainder + arr[i]) % 3
    # Return true if remainder is 0. 
    return (remainder == 0)

def divisible(num):
    n = len(num)
    # add up all the digits of num 
    mysum = sum(num)
    # if num is already is  
    # divisible by 3 then no 
    # digits are to be removed 
    if (mysum % 3 == 0): 
        return 0
    # if there is single digit,  
    # then it is not possible  
    # to remove one digit. 
    if (n == 1): 
        return 0
    # traverse through the number  
    # and find out if any number  
    # on removal makes the sum  
    # divisible by 3 
    for i in range(n): 
        if (mysum % 3 == int(num[i]) % 3): 
            return 1
print(divisible([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]))
```


# Challenge 3 

---

## Part 1: Prepare the Bunnies' Escape
In this challenge you are given a grid which represents "bunny prisoners" and you 
have to break them out but traversing a grid of ones and zeroes, to the top left of (0, 0)
The solution here is a breadth-first path traversal traversing as little nodes as possible.

```python

def path_traversal(wx, hy, maze):
    #Take the width and height of the maze.
    #Then draw up a board
    w = len(maze[0])
    h = len(maze)
    board = [[None for i in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
    board[wx][hy] = 1
    arr = [(wx, hy)]
    while arr:
        x, y = arr.pop(0)
        for i in [[1,0],[-1,0],[0,-1],[0,1]]:
          nx, ny = x + i[0], y + i[1]
          if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w:
            if board[nx][ny] is None:
                board[nx][ny] = board[x][y] + 1
                if maze[nx][ny] == 1 :
                    continue
                arr.append((nx, ny)) 
    return board

def solution(maze):
    w = len(maze[0])
    h = len(maze)
    ans = 2 ** 32-1
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            #Shortest path from start to end
            if path_traversal(0, 0, maze)[i][j] and path_traversal(h-1, w-1, maze)[i][j]:
                ans = min(path_traversal(0, 0, maze)[i][j] + path_traversal(h-1, w-1, maze)[i][j] - 1, ans)
    return ans
```

## Part 2: Fuel Injection Perfection
In this challenge you're given a number and you need to round up or down to 
the nearest base-2 number `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 ...etc]` You must divide it in half until it reaches zero.
However, the acceptable solution cannot use math functions within python 
such as logarithms and division. 

The true answer must use _bitwise operators_ to round up or down. 
Below, I have two answers, both achieve the same means however one is implemented using math and the other bitwise.

```python
import math
#My solution using math and logarithms
def log_solution(num): 
    operation_count = 0
    my_num = int(num)
    #If it can be divided by 2 
    while my_num != 1:
        if my_num % 2 == 0:
            my_num = my_num / 2
            operation_count += 1
        else: #If not a base-2 square root then round to closest
            closest_num = 2**(round(math.log(my_num, 2), 0))
            my_num = closest_num / 2
            operation_count += 1
    return operation_count

#Real solution acceptable by foobar
def solution(numStr):
    num = int(numStr)
    ops = 0
    while(num != 1):
        if (num % 2 == 0):
            num = num / 2
        #If number is greater than 3 
        elif ((num == 3) or ((num + 1) & num) > ((num - 1) & (num - 2))):
            num -= 1
        else:
            num += 1
        ops += 1
    return ops
print(42 & 41)
print(40 & 39)
```

## Part 3: Doomsday Fuel
Here is the part where things get much harder. I had to consult the very resourceful repo [google foobar help](https://github.com/ivanseed/google-foobar-help)
to get a good understanding of what is being asked. Simply put, you need to implement an absorbing markov chain.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
#Greatest common denominators
def gcd(x, y):
    def gcd1(x, y):
        if y == 0:
            return x
        return gcd1(y, x%y)
    return gcd1(abs(x), abs(y))

def simplify(x, y):
    g = gcd(x, y)
    return Fraction(int(x/g), int(y/g))

def lcm(x, y):
    return int(x*y/gcd(x,y))
    
def transform(mat):
    sum_list = list(map(sum, mat))
    bool_indices = list(map(lambda x: x == 0, sum_list))
    indices = set([i for i, x in enumerate(bool_indices) if x])
    new_mat = []

    for i in range(len(mat)):
        new_mat.append(list(map(lambda x: Fraction(0, 1) if(sum_list[i] == 0) else simplify(x, sum_list[i]), mat[i])))

    transform_mat = []
    zeros_mat = []

    for i in range(len(new_mat)):
        if i not in indices:
            transform_mat.append(new_mat[i])
        else:
            zeros_mat.append(new_mat[i])
    transform_mat.extend(zeros_mat)
    tmat = []

    for i in range(len(transform_mat)):
        tmat.append([])
        extend_mat = []
        for j in range(len(transform_mat)):
            if j not in indices:
                tmat[i].append(transform_mat[i][j])
            else:
                extend_mat.append(transform_mat[i][j])
        tmat[i].extend(extend_mat)
    return [tmat, len(zeros_mat)]

def copy_mat(mat):
    cmat = []
    for i in range(len(mat)):
        cmat.append([])
        for j in range(len(mat[i])):
            cmat[i].append(Fraction(mat[i][j].numerator, mat[i][j].denominator))
    return cmat

def gauss_elmination(m, values):
    mat = copy_mat(m)
    for i in range(len(mat)):
        index = -1
        for j in range(i, len(mat)):</CodeBlock>ues[i]
    res = [0 for i in range(len(mat))]
    for i in range(len(mat)):
        index = len(mat) -1 -i
        end = len(mat) - 1
        while end > index:
            values[index] -= mat[index][end] * res[end]
            end -= 1
        res[index] = values[index] / mat[index][index]
    return res

def transpose(mat):
    tmat = []
    for i in range(len(mat)):
        for j in range(len(mat)):
            if i == 0:
                tmat.append([])
            tmat[j].append(mat[i][j])
    return tmat
    
def inverse(mat):
    tmat = transpose(mat)
    mat_inv = []
    for i in range(len(tmat)):
        values = [Fraction(int(i==j), 1) for j in range(len(mat))]
        mat_inv.append(gauss_elmination(tmat, values))
    return mat_inv

def mat_mult(mat1, mat2):
    res = []
    for i in range(len(mat1)):
        res.append([])
        for j in range(len(mat2[0])):
            res[i].append(Fraction(0, 1))
            for k in range(len(mat1[0])):
                res[i][j] += mat1[i][k] * mat2[k][j]
    return res

def splitQR(mat, lengthR):
    lengthQ = len(mat) - lengthR
    Q = []
    R = []
    for i in range(lengthQ):
        Q.append([int(i==j)-mat[i][j] for j in range(lengthQ)])
        R.append(mat[i][lengthQ:])
    return [Q, R]

def solution(mat):
    res = transform(mat)
    if res[1] == len(mat):
        return [1, 1]
    Q, R = splitQR(*res)
    inv = inverse(Q)
    res = mat_mult(inv, R)
    row = res[0]
    l = 1
    for item in row:
        l = lcm(l, item.denominator)
    res = list(map(lambda x: int(x.numerator * l/x.denominator), row))
    res.append(l)
    return res

print(solution([[0, 2, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0,0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]))
```

After this part, you're prompted to optionally hand over your contact info to Google and get in touch with a recruiter. 
The challenges after here get even harder, so much so, that I had to find the answers online and do my best to understand what they're doing. 
Most of the problems below involve very sophisticated math.

# Challenge 4 Distract the Guards

---

## Part 1 
This challenge required you to implement Edmonds' blossom algorithm which in essence, finds the maximum possible edges in a graph.

```python
import math

def check_list(array, u):
    count = 0
    for p in range(3):
        for i in range(len(array)/2):
            for j in list(reversed(range(i,len(array)))):
                if j <= len(array)-1 and j > i and j != i:
                    if is_forever(array[i],array[j]):
                        if(0 <= i <= len(array) and len(array) > 0):
                            u.append(array.pop(i))
                            count += 1
                        if(0 <= j <= len(array) and len(array) > 0):
                            u.append(array.pop(j-1))
                            count += 1
    return count

def validate(banana_list):
    if len(banana_list) > 100:
        temp = []
        counter = 0
        for i in banana_list:
            if counter <= 100:
                temp.append(i)
                counter += 1
        banana_list = temp
    elif len(banana_list) <= 1:
        return len(banana_list)
    for i in banana_list:
        if 1 > i or i >= 2**30:
            banana_list.pop(i)
def answer(banana_list):
    validate(banana_list)
    banana_list = list(banana_list)
    banana_list.sort()
    orig = []
    for i in banana_list:
        orig.append(i)
    u = []
    count1 = checkList(banana_list, u)
    return len(orig) - count1
def is_forever(x, y):
    z = (x + y) / math.gcd(x, y)
    return bool((z - 1) & z)
```


## Part 2: 

Challenge 4 Part II

This challenge required an implementation of Bellman Fords' algorithm.
The program computes the shortest path from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a graph.

```python
import itertools

def solution(times, time_limit):
    num_bunnies = len(times) - 2
    bunny_indices = [bunny + 1 for bunny in range(num_bunnies)]
    distance_matrix = complete_bellman_ford(times)
    if has_negative_cycle(distance_matrix):
        return range(num_bunnies)
    for width in range(num_bunnies, 0, -1):
        for perm in itertools.permutations(bunny_indices, width):
            cost = get_path_cost(perm, distance_matrix)
            if cost <= time_limit:
                return [bunny - 1 for bunny in sorted(perm)]
    return []
def get_path_cost( bunnies, distance_matrix ):
    cost = 0
    for i in range(0, len(bunnies) - 1):
        _from = bunnies[i]
        _to = bunnies[i + 1]
        cost += distance_matrix[_from][_to]
        start_node = 0
        endNode = len(distance_matrix) - 1
        cost += distance_matrix[start_node][bunnies[0]]
        cost += distance_matrix[bunnies[-1]][end_node]
    return cost
def complete_bellman_ford(edges):
    distance_matrix = []
    for vertex in range( len(edges) ):
        distances = bellman_ford(edges, vertex)
        distance_matrix.append(distances)
    return distance_matrix

def bellman_ford(edges, start):
    distances = [ float('inf') for vertex in edges ]
    distances[start] = edges[start][start]
    for i in range(len(edges)):
        for u, v, weight in enumerate_edges(edges):
            if distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
        distances[v] = distances[u] + weight
    return distances
    
def enumerate_edges(edges):
    for u, row in enumerate(edges):
        for v, weight in enumerate(row):
            yield (u, v, weight)

def has_negative_cycle(bellman_ford_matrix):
    distances = bellman_ford_matrix[0]
    for u, v, weight in enumerate_edges(bellman_ford_matrix):
        if distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
            return True
        return False
```
# Challenge 5

---

## Dodge The Lasers!
The final challenge were finally here! This involves implementing the 
Beatty sequence: sequence of integers found by taking the floor of the positive multiples of a positive irrational number


```python
minus_sqrt2 = 4142135623730950488016887242096980785696718753769480731766797379907324784621070388503875343276415727
def solution(str_n):
    n = int(str_n)
    return str(s(n))
def n1(n):
    return (minus_sqrt2*n)//(10**100)
def s(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if n < 1:
        return 0
    return n*n1(n) + n*(n+1)/2 - n1(n)*(n1(n)+1)/2 - s(n1(n))
```

# Bonus: Decrypting the message

After completing all five challenges you're given a message you have to decode and two invite keys to invite some pals to try out the FooBar challenge.

The message was a base64 encoded string that used your username, (e.g. "johndoe") 
as a key to decrypt the final message

```python
import base64

def solution(message, key):
    result = []
    for i, c in enumerate(base64.b64decode(message)):
        result.append(chr(c ^ ord(key[i % len(key)])))
    return ("".join(result))

```

The final message output is this json data


```javascript
{
    "success": "great",
    "colleague": "esteemed",
    "efforts": "incredible",
    "achievement": "unlocked",
    "rabbits": "safe",
    "foo": "win!"
}
```

That's it for the foobar challenge! It was very complex and challenging but in the end, it's a semi-rewarding experience if you have the time.
