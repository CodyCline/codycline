# Intro

```cmake:cmakelists.txt
[requires]
poco/1.9.4

[generators]
cmake
```

```cmake

 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.12)
 project(MD5Encrypter)

 add_definitions("-std=c++11")

 include(${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/conanbuildinfo.cmake)
 conan_basic_setup()

 add_executable(md5 md5.cc)
 target_link_libraries(md5 ${CONAN_LIBS})
```


This is an example of multiple definitions for a single term.

Indent
: (*noun*) A whitespace to align text in a beautiful way.
: (*verb*) To add whitespace to make ugly code beautiful.


[^1]: This is the first footnote.
[^2]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    `{ my code }`

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.
